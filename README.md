# Introduction and Context

The 2020 presidential election was a highly contested and highly anticipated election. Per a national survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, a record 83% of voters answered that the 2020 presidential election “really matters”.1 On the other hand, 2020 was also right in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and voters were concerned about how difficult it would be to vote in the 2020 election. According to the same Pew Research Center survey, about half of registered voters expected to have some difficulties voting. When looking at the breakdown between political parties, 60% of registered Democrats answered that they expected to have difficulties voting while only 35% of Republicans answered the same thing. While COVID-19 is a huge challenge, easier methods of voting also gained a lot more traction such as vote-by-mail and same-day voting. Access and ease of voting is an important factor for both political parties and campaigns. In order to
improve or leverage the current situation, understanding how difficult it is for voters to vote is crucial.
This analysis specifically looks at voting difficulty through a partisan lens. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, about half of overall registered voters reported that they expected to experience difficulty voting but there was a stark difference in percentage between the two major parties. Now that the 2020 election has passed, this analysis aims to look at that partisan divide regarding voting difficulty. Specifically, the goal of this analysis is to address the following research question:
Did Democratic voters or Republican voters experience more difficulty voting in the 2020 election?
Gathering insights into the partisan divide in voting difficulty (if it exists) can assist both parties in better understanding their voter base and championing efforts to improve ease of voting.
